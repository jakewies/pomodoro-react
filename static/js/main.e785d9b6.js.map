These intervals are named pomodoros, the plural in English of the Italian word pomodoro (tomato), after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student. The method is based on the idea that frequent breaks can improve mental agility.\" - Wikipedia'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t),\n\t\t\t\t\t\t_react2.default.createElement(\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'section',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnull,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t_react2.default.createElement(\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'h3',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnull,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'How it works'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t),\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t_react2.default.createElement(\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'p',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnull,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'The Pomodoro provides you with a timer to keep you productive throughout the day.
